                    <p>Growing up in Desuq, Egypt, Zewail faced intense academic pressure and anxiety while pursuing his dreams.

The transition to America for his Ph.D. brought new waves of anxiety - cultural differences, language barriers, and the pressure to prove himself in a foreign academic environment. Through dedication and mental resilience, he not only overcame these challenges but went on to win the 1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, becoming known as the "Father of Femtochemistry."</p>
